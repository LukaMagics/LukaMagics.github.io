# 블록체인과 분산원장의 차이

- The most important difference to remember is that blockchain is just one type of distributed ledger. Although blockchain is a sequence of blocks, distributed ledgers do not require such a chain. Furthermore, distributed ledgers do not need proof of work and offer – theoretically – better scaling options.

- Removing the intermediary party from the equation is what makes the concept of distributed ledger technology so appealing. Unlike blockchain, a distributed ledger does not necessarily need to have a data structure in blocks. A distributed ledger is merely a type of database spread across multiple sites, regions, or participants.

- On the surface, distributed ledger sounds exactly how you probably envision a blockchain. However, all blockchains are distributed ledgers, but remember that not all distributed ledgers are blockchains. Whereas a blockchain represents a type of distributed ledger, it is also merely a subset of them. 

- 요약: 블록체인은 분산원장의 한 종류이다(블록체인⊂분산원장). 예를들어, 블록체인의 chain 연결이 없는 구조가 분산원장의 한 형태가 될 수 있으며, 검증 과정과 블록 안의 자료구조(data structure)가 필요 없을 수 있다.
